# CRUD Menu Program of Hospital Patients

This is a project from the Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp at Purwadhika specifically in the Fundamental Programming module. Based on the given case, I created dummy data about hospital patients. Then work on the project according to the flowchart that has been provided. This program can also handle case sensitive, does not allow empty data and ensures the data in each column is the same to maintain data consistency.
